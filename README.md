# FREE Amazon Buy Bot â€” Open Source GPU/PS5/Xbox Bot

## Description

FREE Amazon Buy Bot is an Add to Cart and Auto Checkout Bot. This auto buying bot can search **multiple** item repeatedly on the item page using `AMAZON_PRODUCT_ID`. Once the desired item is available it can add to cart and checkout very fast. This auto purchasing Bot works on browsers so it can run in all Operating Systems. It can run for multiple items simultaneously. It can bypass Amazon Captcha.

"Running a bot can increase your success chances only ; but does not guarantee that you will successfully cart each time. If you do not agree, then please do not use this code."
